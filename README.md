## ✨ About the Game 
This project is a colorful and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It brings a fresh, vibrant look to the classic 3x3 grid game, making it visually engaging while keeping the rules simple and familiar.

Two players can take turns marking their symbols (X and O) on the board, with the game instantly checking for a winner or a draw. Once a round ends, the board can be reset with a single click, allowing for continuous play. Designed to be lightweight and fully responsive, the game works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers, requiring no installation — just open and play!
